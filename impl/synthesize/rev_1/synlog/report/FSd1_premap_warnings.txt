@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\akita\documents\fsd1\src\uart.v":75:4:75:9|Found inferred clock FSd1|clk24M which controls 547 sequential elements including irx8.r_ready. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
